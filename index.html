                    <p>
                        My name is Gabriel Paulillo I graduated at High School in 2016th. I've started a bachelor in Game Design at Anhembi Morumbi on August in 2017th and I graduated
                        June, 2021st. But I didn't want to work in the area and I got depressed. So, my depression's treatment started and I have started doing livestreams at Twitch until
                        December, 2022, but the money was not enough for me, so I had to figure out what I should do to start making money. So, it was on February, 1st in 2023 when I've 
                        decided to start my self-taught Web Development studies, and that's why I've started studying about programming and now I am loving it. <br>
                        This is my very first Website, actually I don't know what I am going talk in the next weeks, maybe about my studies and my thoughts. Feel free to contact me at
                        any time. I really enjoy playing online games, so invite me.
